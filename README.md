## General Info
This project is a website with two parts: the wiki and the map.

The wiki part contains pages for all countries, puppets and colonies and all their leaders, generals, equipment, battles, divisions and political situation in that country from 1933 to 1945.

The map part is an interactive map similar to google maps with countries and their puppets showed on the map painted according to their faction. The map shows the borders and frontlines for each day from October 1935 (start of the Italo-Ethiopian war) to September 1945 (end of WWII), and also shows the events that happened on a particular day.
